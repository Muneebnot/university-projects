This repository contains my C++ projects developed during my university journey.

## 🚀 How to Run
All projects are written in **C++** and use only simple concepts like arrays, loops, and file handling.  
To run a project:
1. Open the `.cpp` file in any C++ IDE (e.g., **Dev C++**, **Code::Blocks**, or **Visual Studio**).
2. Compile and run the program.

## 📌 Note
- More projects will be added as I progress through my university semesters.  
- Each project has its own dedicated folder and documentation.

## ✨ Future Updates
✔ Add more semester projects  
✔ Improve documentation with screenshots and flowcharts  
✔ Possibly extend projects with better features
