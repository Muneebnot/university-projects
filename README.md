## 🚀 How to Run
All projects are written in C++ and use only simple concepts like arrays, loops, OOP, and file handling.  
To run a project:

1. Open the `.cpp` file in any C++ IDE (e.g., Dev C++, Code::Blocks, or Visual Studio).  
2. Compile and run the program.

## 📌 Note
- More projects will be added as I progress through my university semesters.  
- Each project has its own dedicated folder and documentation.

## ✨ Future Updates
✔ Add more semester projects  
✔ Improve documentation with screenshots and flowcharts  
✔ Possibly extend projects with better features
